# Useful Code Snippets - Controlling an Application w/ Python

These are just some simple examples of python templates to create a database using both PostgreSQL as well as SQLite3.

Some of these solutions I found, and some of the I wrote myself. I will try my best to contain references to ones I found, in order to help keep track of where I found the solutions. As always, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns

All of these scripts are free to use. I also do not claim to have written all of these codes just some of them. I have just found them to be useful, and they are available about the open source realms.
