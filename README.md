# Useful Code Snippets - Python3

The purpose of this library is to collect useful little codes that I've needed to do certain things in python. In general, scripts that are located in this respository are ones that can be integrated into any script/code for python3. This is really just to help myself, but hopefully helps other people as well.

I will try my best to contain references to them, in order to help keep track of where I found the solutions. As always, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns

## License

All of these scripts are free to use, I have found them around various forums. I also do not claim to have written these codes, I have just found them to be useful.

## Acknowledgments

* To all the people who contribute answers to help people to do code, thank you. I will do my best to make citations.
